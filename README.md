## General info

My second big project created in MERN stack with typescript. I decided to make use of the skills I gained from the previous project (Swapbook), but also learn something new. Thats why (comparing to previous project) I used:

- React-Hook-Form except of Formik
- Zod except of Yup
- Prisma except of Mongoose on Backend

## Features

- Authentication and authorization (JWT in backend cookie)
- 2 Languages (And possibility to change them whenever somebody want)
- Dark and Light mode
- Infinite Scroll (separated into two custom Hooks, with dynamic queries and pages)
- Post creation
- Liking, unliking Posts
- Commenting Posts
- Following and Unfollowing other people (Follows are displayed)
- Counters of profile views, likes under Posts, follows etc.
- Search posts by author or description
- Possibility to see other Person profile
- Desktop and mobile navbars
- Dynamic dialogs on desktop (their functionalities are included into mobile menu)
